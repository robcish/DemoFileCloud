# DemoFileCloud

**Goal:** Write a demo app showcasing your technical skills,
understanding of the platform and overall attention to details.

**Language:** Kotlin

**Requirements:**
• Setup a GitHub public repo. All work should be done within that repo using proper Git etiquette.

> Here we are, but I skipped other branches and pull requests :)

• Populate a list view, by extracting data from a public API of your choice. The complexity of the data presented is up to you.

> "Giphy" API with recyclerView (instead of poor listView), preview of last 25 trending gifs.

• In the top right corner, a button should take the user to a “virtual CV” screen. This screen must match [this exact design](https://www.figma.com/file/HBk47Lh9jTB25NPNOYSdoQ/CodeLathe-Technical-Test). You can use assets of your choice, except for the font which is [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter). Note that you can either do your own CV, someone else’s, or copy the one in the example.

> Done, Written in Compose

• You can do any bonus you want, as long as the previous requirements are still there.

> Gif search mechanism with 2 second debounce - to prevent sending request after each letter if typing quickly.
Detail Screen after clicking GIF with some data there.

• Submit a ready-to-build repo link.

> Here we are.
